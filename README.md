To run the application simply select the zip file and right click there will be an option to "extract all".
once extracted open the file containing "part 1" in it
After openening the file select the option that is classified as a "visual studio solution" type
Once opened simply open all the classes and run from the main which can be found in the "mainClass"

Changes made: 
Added colour when displaying recipe outputs like, when the full recipe must be displayed or when the recipe gets scaled up or down the outputs are different colours
Addressed some of the exception handling errors but not all, made sure that for most events the user will be asked to re-enter their data if they provide the wrong data type
And changed to .NET 4.8 even though it was already in 4.8
